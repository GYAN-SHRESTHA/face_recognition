# face_recognition

This project presents an approach to the detection of human facial features and thereby the
recognition of the person in real time. The project can be used in security as well as image
based query search problems. Our system tracks the subject's face and then recognizes the
person and identifies his/her current location by comparing the characteristics of the person's
face to the ones available in our database. Faces may be described by a 2-D characteristic view
and the face images are turned onto a feature space using the subspace LDA which encodes
the distinct facial features and variations. The system contains steady camera located in various
locations which is used to capture real time video. The system recognizes the faces in the video
and firstly it checks whether the person that is intended to be identified is in video or not. The
process continues for all camera. Then if the person to be found out is in within the range of
the camera then the location of the person is displayed in the web application which is
interfaced in our system.
